## 1. Aim
The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive, interactive analysis of social media performance across multiple platforms—YouTube, LinkedIn, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X.com—to support strategic decision-making and optimize content delivery for increased reach and engagement.

---

## 2. Objectives
- To identify performance trends across platforms, regions, and post types.
- To determine key drivers of impressions, views, and engagement.
- To offer stakeholders actionable insights using intuitive data visuals.
- To provide a scalable report structure suitable for real-time monitoring and optimization.

---

## 3. Methodology
The analysis was carried out using **Power BI Desktop**, with the following data preparation and modeling steps:

- ✅ **Data Cleaning & Preparation**:
  - Replaced all `null` values with `0` to ensure accuracy in aggregations.
  - Verified and corrected **data types** across all columns (e.g., text, date, integer).
  - Removed duplicates and handled missing timestamps.

- ✅ **Data Modeling**:
  - Created relationships between content, platform, and metrics tables.
  - Built **custom columns and calculated measures using DAX** (e.g., Engagement Rate, CTR).

- ✅ **Formatting**:
  - Renamed columns for clarity and consistency.
  - Applied human-readable formatting (e.g., 6bn, 4.81bn) to KPIs.

---

## 4. Report Design Approach
- 🎨 Designed a **custom dark theme** using the [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) theme generator to ensure visual consistency and accessibility.
- 🖼️ Created background templates using **PowerPoint**, then imported them into Power BI for layout uniformity.
- 🎯 Developed a layout structure with a balance of KPIs, charts, maps, and filters tailored to each page’s focus.

## 5. Power BI Features Used
- 📌 **Slicers**: For filtering by Region, Platform, Post Type, and Day of Week.
- 🧭 **Navigation Buttons**: Used for seamless page switching.
- 🔖 **Bookmarks**: Implemented to create interactive content views and highlight insights.
- 📊 **ZoomCharts Visuals**: Used for advanced interaction and drill-down.
- 📌 **Drill-through Functionality**: For detailed post-level analysis.
- 🧩 **Decomposition Tree**: To analyze views across multiple hierarchical categories.

---

## 6. Key Insights & Outcome
- **Instagram and YouTube** generated the highest engagement rates.
- **Weekends** showed the most consistent peak in post views and interactions.
- **Video content** outperformed static posts across all platforms.
- **USA, UK, and Canada** had the highest volume of impressions and views.

## 7. Challenges
- Designing **different layout styles for each report page** while maintaining thematic consistency.
- Balancing performance with visual interactivity due to use of rich custom visuals.
- Creating a responsive layout that adapts to different screen resolutions.
- Managing bookmarks and button actions across multiple pages for a seamless experience.

---

## 8. Recommendations
- Implement real-time or scheduled data refresh to maintain up-to-date insights.
- Include sentiment analysis or text-based metrics in future iterations.
- Introduce user role-based views (e.g., content team vs. executive dashboard).
- Consider integrating campaign-level filters for more targeted analysis.
